 Overview
This project develops a robust **Disease Prediction Model** using structured medical datasets. The system supports multiple classification algorithms (e.g., Logistic Regression, SVM, Random Forest, XGBoost) and is designed as a decision-support tool—not a replacement for professional medical diagnosis.

 Diagram
The flowchart above illustrates the system’s primary components:
- **Input**: Patient data (e.g., age, blood pressure, glucose level, symptoms)  
- **Data Processing**: Cleaning, normalization, feature engineering  
- **Modeling**: Training and evaluating multiple ML algorithms  
- **Output**: Disease likelihood prediction

Features
- **Multi-Disease Support**: Can predict conditions like diabetes, heart disease, or cancer
- **Multiple Algorithm Options**: Compare performance across Logistic Regression, SVM, Random Forest, XGBoost
- **Tunable Pipelines**: Easily swap in new algorithms or extend features
- **Comprehensive Evaluation**: Accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, ROC/AUC

 Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/disease-prediction-model.git
    cd disease-prediction-model
    ```
2. Create and activate a virtual environment:
    ```bash
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
    ```
3. Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

 Usage

1. Place your dataset(s) in the `data/` directory (e.g., `heart.csv`, `diabetes.csv`).
2. Run preprocessing and model training:
    ```bash
    python train.py --dataset data/heart.csv --model random_forest
    ```
3. Make predictions on new data:
    ```bash
    python predict.py --model output/random_forest.pkl --input data/new_samples.csv
    ```
 How It Works
1. **Data Loading & Cleaning**: Handles missing values, performs normalization or encoding.
2. **Feature Engineering**: Derives new features or selects important ones to improve accuracy.
3. **Model Training**: Fits chosen classification models using cross-validation.
4. **Evaluation**: Outputs Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score, ROC Curve.
5. **Prediction**: Serializes the trained model for inference on new cases.
Evaluation Metrics
- **Accuracy**: Overall correctness of the model
- **Precision / Recall / F1-Score**: Trade-offs between false positives and false negatives
- **ROC-AUC**: Measures model’s separability performance
